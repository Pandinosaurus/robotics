The above exposition can be directly generalized to an arbitrary number of wheels, mounted in arbitrary locations. Some care needs to be taken that the chosen configuration is not singular, which would result in being only to move in one particular direction (or not at all!).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general we want a robot to move in a particular direction in the warehouse, or, in general in *world coordinates*. In this chapter we have assumed that the robot orientation is aligned with the warehouse orientation, so conveniently we have to do nothing.However, if one were to model the robot's orientation, we would simply have to rotate the desired world velocity into the body coordinate frame. We will see how to do this later in this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we *do* care about orientation, omni wheels can actually be used to *rotate* the robot, as well. Think about applying the same constant angular velocity to all three wheels: the robot will now simply rotate in place. In other words, we could add a *third* column to the Jacobian matrix that translates a desired angular velocity into wheel velocities. That will allow us to command any combination of linear and angular velocity.\n",

    "Finally, there is a second type of wheel, the \"mecanum wheel\", where the rollers are *not* aligned with the wheel rim, but are rotated by some (constant) amount. That complicates the math a little bit, but in the end we will again obtain a Jacobian matrix. We will not discuss this further."
