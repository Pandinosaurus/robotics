    "- State:        2D, i.e., $(x,y)$\n",
    "- Actuators:    Omni wheels\n",
    "- Sensors:      Proximity, range, and GPS-like\n",
    "- Perception:   Localization (Markov, Monte Carlo, Kalman)\n",
    "- Planning:     Graph-based, configuration space\n",
    "- Learning:     Learning a motion model\n",
    "\n",
    "The state will for the first time be continuous. We just operate in 2D translation space for now, because adding orientation adds complexity, mainly because of the nonlinearities inherent in sine/cosine evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "As actuators (described in the next section) we use omni-directional or \"Swedish\" wheels, which allows us to move in x and y without constraint. This is in contrast to cars and bicycles, which are \"non-holonomic\".\n",
    "\n",
    "As sensors, we will discuss three different type of sensors one might encounter in a warehouse scenario. We derive an observation models which we can then use in perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perception in this chapter is limited to *localizing* in these 2D environments, given an a priori map. We first look at \"Markov Localization\", which is a straightforward application of HMMs. We then look at a particle filter as a better alternative. When applied to localization, the resulting algorithm is called \"Monte Carlo Localization\". Finally, as an advanced technique, Kalman smoothing is discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To plan our actions, we use graph-based approaches to plan in configuration space."
