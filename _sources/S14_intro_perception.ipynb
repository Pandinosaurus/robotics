    "For example, in the noiseless case, if a range sensor is 10 meters from wall, we can easily predict that the sensor reading\n",
    "will be $z = 10$.  The inverse problem is to determine something about the state of the world, given \n",

    "combined with contextual knowledge (is it flu season? has there been an outbreak of flu in the past days?).\n",
    "In other words, they perform inference by fusing multiple sources of evidence, and\n",
    "considering the context for the evidence. Bayes law, from probability theory, is the tool\n",
