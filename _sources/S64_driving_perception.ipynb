However, very fast *approximate* nearest neighbor algorithms are available. Many of these use specialized data structures, such as \"KD-trees\" or \"Oct-trees\" (in 3D). While the details are out of scope, intuitively these data structures  recursively divide up the point clouds into sub-clouds, such that sub-clouds unlikely to contain the nearest neighbor can be quickly excluded. We build this data structure ones for the second cloud, and then use it for all nearest neighbor searches, leading to complexity which is approximately $O(N \\log N$)."
